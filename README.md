# Earnings-Based Trading Strategy Checklist

1. **Identify Stocks with Upcoming Earnings**
   - List companies reporting earnings the next day.
   - Filter by stock price range: $50 - $150.

2. **Categorize by ETF/Sector**
   - Match each stock with its primary ETF or sector (e.g., tech, healthcare).
   - Review sector-specific ETF performance (1-day & 1-week) to gauge overall sentiment.

3. **Analyze Stock Ratings & Technical Indicators**
   - Gather analyst ratings for each stock.
   - Check technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, moving averages) to assess momentum and trends.

4. **Filter Based on Earnings-Related News & Social Media Sentiment**
   - Search for recent news on earnings, using Google and Twitter, to understand sentiment.
   - For pre-market stocks, review news overnight; for post-market, check throughout the day.

5. **Spotting Momentum & Fake Rallies**
   - Examine pre-earnings movement to detect early momentum.
   - Post-earnings, monitor volume spikes and price consistency to distinguish a genuine rally from a potential fake-out.

6. **Execution Strategy**
   - Set a stop-limit buy order *above* the current price for confirmed upward momentum.
   - Aim for a no-loss entry point by adjusting your stop-limit to catch upward rallies while avoiding significant dips.
